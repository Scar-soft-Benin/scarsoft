## üìö Installation & Setup

### üê≥ Running the Project with Docker
Scar-Soft's project is dockerized to ensure consistent environments across team members (Linux and Windows). The setup includes services for the React frontend, Laravel backend, MySQL database, and Nginx web server.

#### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Git

#### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Omo-oba18/scarsoft.git
   cd scarsoft
   ```
2. **Set Up Environment**:
   Copy the .env.example file to server/.env for Laravel configuration:
   sh

   ```
   cp .env.example server/.env
   ```

   - Build and Start the Containers:
   Run the following command to build and start all services:
   sh

      ```
      docker-compose up -d --build
      ```

      This will:
      Build images for PHP, Nginx, and MySQL

      Start containers for the frontend (Node.js), backend (PHP-FPM), MySQL, and Nginx Link services via the scarsoft-network network

   - Install Dependencies:
      Frontend (React):
      ```
      docker-compose exec node npm install
      ```
      Backend (Laravel):
      ```
      docker-compose exec php composer install
      ```

    - Configure Laravel:
      Generate the application key:
      ``` 
      docker-compose exec php php artisan key:generate
      ```
   - Run database migrations:
   ```
   docker-compose exec php php artisan migrate
   ```
   - Access the Application:
      Frontend (React app): http://localhost:5173

      Backend (Laravel API): http://localhost/api

      MySQL (optional, for debugging): Connect to localhost:3306 with credentials scarsoft_user/secret

   - View Logs (for debugging):
   ```
   docker-compose logs <service> 
   docker-compose logs php
   ```
   Stopping the Containers:
   Stop running containers:
   
   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

   To remove containers, volumes, and images:
   ```
   docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all
   ```
   - Development Workflow
      Frontend: Changes in client/ are hot-reloaded via Vite (http://localhost:5173).

      Backend: Changes in server/ are automatically reflected (PHP-FPM reloads).

      Database: Persistent data is stored in the mysql-data Docker volume.

   - Troubleshooting
   Permission Issues: Ensure Laravel‚Äôs storage directories are writable:
   ```
   docker-compose exec php chmod -R 775 /var/www/html storage /var/www/html/bootstrap/cache
   ```

      MySQL Connection: Verify DB_HOST=mysql in server/.env.

      Port Conflicts: If ports 80 or 3306 are in use, edit docker-compose.yml (e.g., change 80:80 to 8080:80).
